Prompt 1: provide 6 given-when-then acceptance criteria and 6 constraints and assumptions for a system that takes a list of calandar events as an dict [str, str]  and a meeting duration as a int and the day as str and outputs avaible time as a list of str

LLM response: 

Architected acceptance criteria and constraints for meeting scheduling system
Acceptance Criteria (Given-When-Then)
AC1: Find Available Slots Between Meetings
Given a calendar with events {"09:00-10:00", "11:00-12:00", "14:00-15:00"}
When searching for a 30-minute meeting on "2024-03-15"
Then the system returns ["10:00-10:30", "10:30-11:00", "12:00-12:30", "12:30-13:00", "13:00-13:30", "13:30-14:00", "15:00-15:30", "15:30-16:00", "16:00-16:30", "16:30-17:00"]

AC2: Empty Calendar Returns Full Day Availability
Given an empty calendar {}
When searching for a 60-minute meeting on "2024-03-15"
Then the system returns all available slots from start of business day to end (e.g., "09:00-10:00", "10:00-11:00", ... "16:00-17:00")

AC3: No Available Slots When Fully Booked
Given a calendar with continuous events {"09:00-13:00", "13:00-17:00"}
When searching for a 30-minute meeting on "2024-03-15"
Then the system returns an empty list []

AC4: Meeting Duration Exceeds Available Gaps
Given a calendar with events {"09:00-11:00", "12:00-14:00"}
When searching for a 120-minute meeting on "2024-03-15"
Then the system returns only slots that can accommodate the full duration (e.g., ["14:00-16:00", "16:00-18:00"] if working hours extend to 18:00)

AC5: Handles Back-to-Back Meetings
Given a calendar with events {"09:00-10:00", "10:00-11:00"}
When searching for a 30-minute meeting on "2024-03-15"
Then the system returns available slots starting from "11:00" onward, not attempting to squeeze meetings between back-to-back events

AC6: Respects End of Business Day Boundary
Given a calendar with events {"09:00-16:00"}
When searching for a 90-minute meeting on "2024-03-15" with business hours ending at 17:00
Then the system returns an empty list [] as the remaining 60 minutes is insufficient

Constraints and Assumptions
C1: Business Hours Definition
Constraint: The system operates within defined business hours (default: 09:00-17:00)
Assumption: All available time slots must fall within business hours; no meetings scheduled outside this range
C2: Time Format Standardization
Constraint: All times in the calendar dict must follow "HH:MM-HH:MM" format (24-hour clock)
Assumption: Input validation ensures properly formatted strings; invalid formats will raise exceptions
C3: Non-Overlapping Events
Assumption: Calendar events in the input dict do not overlap with each other
Constraint: System does not validate or handle overlapping events; behavior is undefined if overlaps exist
C4: Meeting Duration Granularity
Constraint: Meeting duration is specified in minutes and available slots align to time increments (e.g., 30-minute blocks)
Assumption: The system suggests slots at regular intervals (e.g., every 30 minutes: "09:00", "09:30", "10:00")
C5: Same-Day Scheduling Only
Constraint: The system only processes events for the specific day provided; no multi-day consideration
Assumption: All calendar events in the dict belong to the day specified; cross-day events are out of scope
C6: No Buffer Time Between Meetings
Assumption: Available slots can start immediately after an existing event ends (e.g., if event ends at 10:00, next slot can start at 10:00)
Constraint: If buffer time is required (e.g., 15-minute breaks), this must be handled by the calling system or added as a future feature
